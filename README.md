# Gravity_modelling v_1.9
My bachelor's thesis project that is constantly being modificated.

I made this as my thesis work and it's full name was "Physics phenomena, objects and processes modelling system".
The program was written in C++, using DX11 and Assimp libraries.
Here's the tips for "how to use it":

controls:
enter - enable fullscreen;
mouse - look up/down/left/right;
w/a/s/d - move;
shift - toggle 3x speed acceleration;
1 - create gravity center with mass 10^15 kg's;
2 - create object in random place with mass 10^6 kg's;
3 - turn on the gravity;
esc - exit.

As it was exciting for me to make it, I'm still working on some changes and modifications, constantly shaping program to be
something more then just thesis project. Dunno when I will stop, but now, let it be here on GitHub)
